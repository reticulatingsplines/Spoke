# Bandwidth Integration

Bandwidth.com is a telephone service API company. To use Bandwidth, set `DEFAULT_SERVICE=bandwidth`. The `sticky-sender` and `num-picker` service managers are required for the Bandwidth extension to work. Make sure to include `SERVICE_MANAGERS=sticky-sender,numpicker-basic`. `sticky-sender` must come before `numpicker-basic` in the `SERVICE_MANAGERS` environment variable.
